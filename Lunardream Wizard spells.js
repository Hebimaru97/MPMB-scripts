	descriptionFull : "You conjure a swarm of flaming elemental butterflies in a 15ft radius sphere within range. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. When an affected creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d8 fire damage and begins burning. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not ignited. At the end of a burning creature's turn, it takes 2d8 fire damage. This continues until a creature uses an action to douse the flames. The swarm ignites flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried. If you are within 60 feet of the swarm, you can move it up to 30 feet as a bonus action on your turn."

	descriptionFull : "The spell creates a sphere of astral energy around the creature, granting it immunity to the triggering damage by opening a small rift to the astral plane. The creature also gains resistance to all subsequent damage it would take until the start of your next turn. This spell has a chance of failing outright. Roll a d6. On a result of 1, the spell fails and the spell slot is expended. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, choose one additional creature for each spell slot above 5th."
